This is a sample Signadot Resource Plugin to provision an empty MariaDB instance
for each Signadot Sandbox that requests one.

This directory contains the sources for the `signadot/hotrod-mariadb-plugin`
container image, which is used by the `resource-plugin.yaml` file.
It is not necessary to build this image yourself in order to try the demo.
